Challenge: Two Sum

Given an array of integers 'nums' and an integer 'target', 
return the indices of the two numbers such that they 
add up to the 'target'.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
and you may not use the same element twice. 

You can return the answer in any order.

Example:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, so the output is [0, 1].

Constraints:

- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
