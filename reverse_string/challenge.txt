Reverse String Coding Challenge

Challenge:

Write a function or method that reverses a given string.

Problem Statement:

You are required to implement a solution that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.

Example:

Input:
"Hello, World!"

Output:
"!dlroW ,olleH"

Constraints:

- The input string will only contain printable ASCII characters.
- Consider the case where the input string is empty.

Evaluation Criteria:

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Correctness: The solution should produce the correct output for the given input.
- Efficiency: Aim for an optimal solution with respect to time and space complexity.
- Readability: Write clean, well-organized code with meaningful variable names and comments where necessary.
