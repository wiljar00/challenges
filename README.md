# Coding Challenges

Welcome to the Interview Coding Challenges project! This repository is a collection of coding challenges, each with solutions implemented in various programming languages. The challenges are organized into individual sub-directories, and each sub-directory contains solutions in different languages.

## Structure

The project follows a specific structure for organizing challenges and their solutions:

- **Challenges Directory:**
  - The root directory is named `challenges`.
  - Inside this directory, each coding challenge has its own sub-directory.

- **Challenge Sub-Directories:**
  - Each challenge is represented by a sub-directory, named descriptively.
  - For example, `reverse_string` is a challenge directory.

- **Challenge Description:**
  - Within each challenge directory, there is an `md` file providing a detailed description of the coding challenge.
  - For example, the challenge description for reversing a string is found in `challenges/reverse_string/README.md`.

- **Language-Specific Directories:**
  - Inside each challenge directory, there are sub-directories for solutions in different programming languages.
  - For example, the C++ solution for reversing a string is found in `challenges/reverse_string/c++/main.cpp`, and the Ruby solution is in `challenges/reverse_string/ruby/main.rb`.



# TODO:
 - add a test to each file and leave the solution blank. 
 - this will help understand the questions better by writing expectations in tests
