# There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two
# conditions:
# 1. The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
# 2. The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
# These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.

# Complete the 'getTotalX' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
# The function accepts following parameters:
#  1. INTEGER_ARRAY a
#  2. INTEGER_ARRAY b
#

def getTotalX(a, b)
    # Write your code here

end


a = [2, 6]
b = [24, 36]
