# Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly 
#   four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two 
#   space-separated long integers.

# Complete the 'miniMaxSum' function below.
#
# The function accepts INTEGER_ARRAY arr as parameter.
#

def miniMaxSum(arr)
    # Write your code here

    min = 0
    max = 0

    puts "#{min} #{max}"
end

array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
# expected result: 
# 16, 24
miniMaxSum(array)
